You will play as President Roh, the second-generation dictator of the military-focused autocratic country \nNew Balgot Republic (aka. NRB).\nOriginally part of the Balgot Republic, NRB has been parted out as a separate country after the internal coup of Balgot happened 80 years ago. \nTo confront the economically stable Balgot, NRB has been devoted to developing \nand weaponizing nuclear against the denuclearization agreement among other countries, \nand now is the only nation that officially possesses long-range launchable nuclear missiles.\n After this development, NRB brought a new tension of war into the Aka continent, which divided the continent into a possible warzone; \nUnited Bratva as the ally of NRB, and Shima Rengo as the joint military partner of Balgot Republic.\nYou are currently in a very unstable situation; the weakened trust and support from your internal advocates, \nand the rumor that one other country also secretly has been developing nuke.\n You are losing the long-time dictatorship power and your leverage among neighbor nations by possessing the nuke starts to fade away.\nYour goal as the leader of NRB is to secure the national autonomy of your nation and to avoid war at the same time. \nBe considerate of every action and choice you make. The fate of your country and the world are in your hands.");
